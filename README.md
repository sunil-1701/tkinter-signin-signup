tkinter based GUI Sign-up and Sign-in module using client-server archuitecture
The client and server-based sign-up and sign-in module project in Python is an application that provides a secure and convenient way for users to create accounts and log in to access their personalized content. 
The project is based on a client-server architecture, which includes two separate components: the client-side and the server-side. 
The client-side is the user interface, which allows the user to enter their login credentials, while the server-side handles the user authentication, data storage, and communication between the client and server.
